# FEniCS_Poroelasticity_Biot
FEniCS code for Poroelasticity (Biot's model)

In this project, we use FEniCS to solve three-field Biot's model with different algorithms:
- Fully coupled algorithms
- Sequential decoupled algorithms (TBD)
- Iterative decoupled algorithms (TBD)

There are some relevant papers in the "doc" folder.
